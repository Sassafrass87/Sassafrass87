- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sassafrass87
- 👀 I’m interested in learning ethical hacking. Currently looking for someone who's interested in mentoring me as I get stuck sometimes and would be nice to ask some questions as I don't know anyone who does this. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics and whatever else I can get my hands on 😅
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on 🙄 learning. 
- 📫 How to reach me feel free to email me at afrasssass87@gmail.com
